FastQuery provides a simple API for indexing and querying scientific format
datasets using the FastBit bitmap index technology. 
Datasets can be retrieved using complex compound range queries such as "(energy > 100)
&& (70 < pressure < 90)". The bitmap index technology only retrieves
the data elements that satisfy the query condition and shows
significant speedup compared with reading the entire datasets. 

Current support file format:
--- HDF5 
--- NETCDF (only supported in seralized mode)
--- BP (under testing)

Current support data type:
--- double
--- float
--- byte:char
--- int:int32_t
--- uint:uint32_t
--- long:int64_t
--- ulong:uint64_t
